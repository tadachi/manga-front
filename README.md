# get-going

My personal template that contains most of the frameworks I use for my own projects.

## Install

In the project directory with *package.json* file.

```bash
$ npm install
```

A folder called *node_modules* will be created.

Rest assured, it is git ignored so it will not be accidentally added to the repo.

## Run

```bash
$ node dev-server.js
```
